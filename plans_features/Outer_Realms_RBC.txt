This feature will let me join Outer Realms event and start attacking a single hardcoded coordinates RBC.

Steps:
1. Calculate max attackers unit limit per attack wave depending on the RBC level.
2. Calculate flanks and front unit limit based on the max attackers calculated at step 1.
3. Calculate the number of victories needed for each RBC level up.





Max Attackers:
CombatConst.getMaxAttackers(rbc_level) = 320 if rbc_level > 69 else min(260, 5 * rbc_level + 8)

Flank Unit Limit:
floor(0.2 * CombatConst.getMaxAttackers(rbc_level))

Front Unit Limit:
floor(0.6 * CombatConst.getMaxAttackers(rbc_level))

Victory Wins (rbc_level, kingdom_id = 1 (should be 0 but it's 1 due to calling other functions meanwhile)):
floor(pow((rbc_level + 1 - 1) / 1.9, 1.8)) - floor(pow((rbc_level - 1) / 1.9, 1.8))
